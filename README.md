# Shiny Apps for EDUC 275B at UC Berkeley

This is a collcetion of Shiny apps for the course EDUC 275B (Data Analysis in Education Research II, by Professor Sophia Rabe-Hesketh) at UC Berkeley. The motivation behind the apps is to have interactive graphics that I can use for living demos during lab sessions.
